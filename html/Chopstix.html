        <br><br>
            The issue that is explored is that Asian cuisine can be difficult to find, and there are not many forums specifically for this ordeal. This was confirmed after conducting interviews, where most agreed with this statement.
       These issues led me to create an app concept catered towards Asian cuisine in addition to social networking between foodies and newbies. I, myself, am a foodie with a food Instagram so I am able to utilize my personal experience and gripes as well as my fellow foodies' opinions.

<h1>Discussion Forum</h1>
  
  One feature that many food review apps lack is a discussion forum. Since Chopstix is catered towards foodies, it is only fitting to have a social space where users can interact and ask questions. Through this forum, users can discuss whatever they want and have opportunities to make new connections. <br><br>

 <div class="topic">01. Research \</div>

<p>

<div class="desc"> I defined a foodie as someone who is an avid user of food review apps, such as using them at least 2-3 times a week, or who has a strong social media presence in the food realm. A newbie, on the other hand, would be someone who is either inexperienced in using such apps or more new to Asian cuisine. <br> <br> Utilizing my network, I conducted 5 interviews total; I interviewed 3 foodies and asked them various questions, such as what food apps they use, their ideal features in a foodie app, how they discover foods and foodies, and if they have difficulty finding Asian cuisine. I also interviewed 2 others who are newbies so I could accomodate to those interested in trying new foods.
I found that 80% agreed it could be difficult to find Asian cuisine, confirming my proposal.
<br><br>

I also analyzed app reviews (those that I chose for competitive analysis), sorting by both critical and most useful to obtain an open perspective of what users were both happy and unhappy about. Utilizing the most common complaints, I targeted these issues. <br><br>

<div class="findings">
<h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <br>
5 Interviews Total <br><br>
<ul>High Priority</ul>
<ul><ul>‚Ä¢ Easy to find recommendations</ul></ul>

<div class="desc"> I chose top food review apps in the App Store, which were Yelp, Foursquare, and the Infatuation. I also chose ChowBus due to its focus on Asian cuisine. The key features that I compared were recommendations, bookmarks, homepage, and forum. <br><br>

 <div class="desc"> Revisiting my project in March, I gathered a participant group of 5 users, which included both foodies and newbies, and created a set of tasks for them to complete while user testing. After testing, I had them answer a Google forms link with questions to gather feedback, keeping in mind the overall goals of the app and how the features could be improved. <br><br>
  <ul>‚Ä¢ Introduced the project background and goals</ul>

    <br><br><br><br>
      <div class="topic">Colors & Accessibility \</div> 
      <div class="desc"> As mentioned in a previous section, I changed the color palette slightly after my second iteration. I took WCAG guidelines into account to ensure accessibility. I changed the color of the buttons in order to improve the color contrast and meet the AA standards. In addition, I replaced pure black with a lighter variant, as black and white are the highest contrast and tend to be straining on the eyes. <br><br>

        I also increased the font sizes so the items would be easier to read and spaced out buttons in order to follow touch target guidelines.
        <br><br><br><br>

<div class="topic">Iteration 2 + Changes \ </div> 
      <div class="desc"> Overall, the following features were added or changed: <br><br>

  <ul> <ul> ‚Ä¢ Map to see where places are relative to the user</ul></ul>
   <ul>  <ul>‚Ä¢ Option to see friends/following list's posts </ul></ul>

        <ul> Features based on my research/perspective: </ul>

<ul>  <ul>‚Ä¢ Interactive buttons on discussion posts</ul></ul>

<div class="desc"> As a goal of providing Asian cuisine reviews and a concern of reliability from the "Foodie" persona, I added a "verified" status next to the user's name on their profile so when others view it, they will know that they are looking at someone who is reliable. <br><br> In addition, I made slight changes to the description so it would be more visually accessible, such as making the font size larger and providing more line-height spacing. </div>

<div class="desc"> I made changes to the overall appearance of the discussion forum as I felt it looked a bit cluttered. My changes were also based on accessibility and easier to read text, all while creating a neater appearance. <br><br> Based on user feedback, they wanted a way to view their "following" or friends list and see what they were up to. As a result, I added filters and a following button. <br><br> Generally, a discussion thread has the ability to like, dislike, or reply to comments, so I added these options for a more interactive flow. I also added more information about the users.  </div>

 <div class="topic">04. Reflection \</div>

<p>

<div class="desc"> This was the first personal UX project I'd ever completed and I learned a lot from the process. I found it interesting from my interviews and research to see what users value in food apps and apps in general. <br>
      In the end, I was able to hit all the points from my key findings based on my initial interviews.
      <br><br> I revisited this design in March 2021, as previously, I felt that I could have done more of the UX process, so that is what I did. I gathered some user feedback through user testing and really enjoyed doing so; doing user testing allowed me to see things from a different perspective and implement new features I hadn't thought of. In addition, I learned more about accessibility and how it plays a role in design.
As for what I would improve about it, I would create a dark mode and add more flows. <br><br>
      
      Lastly, as a personal aside, it was fun how I was able to incorporate my own food photography pictures into the design.
